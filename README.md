# mineralcatalog_search

Some notes on the app.

A note on the groups and why this should pass...

I took a bit of a different approach to the filtering by group name.  I used an accordion
to allow users to select the mineral they like from a list of minerals grouped per the instructions.
This approach meets that as the minerals are available in the list view vis a vis the layout template.

The search functionality will still display minerals in the core mineral container.
